# 📝💠 JSON-LD editor from SHACL shape

A React component to generate web forms from SHACL shapes. It aims to help developers to easily setup a user-friendly web form with validation to retrieve informations, or any metadata, from users. The data generated by the form is in JSON-LD RDF, complying with the SHACL shape used to generate the form.

The component first convert the SHACL shape to JSON Schema, then it displays a web form with validation. 

⚠️ The predicate `sh:or` is not fully supported. This is a design choice, since the goal is to build a form the best is to use straightforward shapes where the best way to represent the data is defined (and not all the possible ways) 

Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).

Deployed as a static website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## 👩‍💻 Usage

Define your SHACL shape, here is an example of a straightforward shape that will be properly rendered by the form:

```tsx
const shaclShape = `@prefix : <http://purl.org/hcls-metadata-spec/> .
@prefix dctypes: <http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/> .
@prefix xsd:   <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix rdfs:  <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix dct:   <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix sh:    <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .
@prefix rdf:   <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix lexvo: <http://lexvo.org/id/iso639-3/> .
@prefix dcat:  <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#> .

:HCLSDistributionShape
    a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:nodeKind sh:IRI ;
    sh:targetClass dcat:Distribution ;
    sh:targetObjectsOf dcat:distribution ;
    sh:severity sh:Info ;

    sh:property [
        sh:path dct:title ;
        sh:severity sh:Violation ;
        sh:minCount 1;
        sh:or ( [ sh:datatype xsd:string ] [ sh:datatype rdf:langString ] )
        sh:nodeKind sh:Literal
    ] ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path dct:language ;
        sh:severity sh:Warning ;
        sh:message "Distribution SHOULD use dct:language with a lexvo URI: http://lexvo.org/id/iso639-3/{tag}" ;
        sh:nodeKind sh:IRI
    ] .`
```

Instantiate the JSON-LD form providing the SHACL shape and the target shape used to generate the form:

```tsx
import { JsonldForm } from 'json-ld-editor-react';

const shaclShape = `Your SHACL shape here...`

return(
    <JsonldForm 
        shape={shaclShape} 
        target="http://purl.org/hcls-metadata-spec/HCLSDistributionShape" 
    />
)
```

## 👩‍💻 Access

Access the website at **[https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor 🔗](https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor)**

A few URL parameters can be provided to automate some actions:

* **Provide the JSON-LD file to load** with `edit=https://my-jsonld`
  * e.g. https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor?edit=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/csvw/gh-pages/tests%2Ftest086-metadata.json
  * It will automatically load the JSON-LD available at this URL, and the ontology provided in `@context`. 
  * It also deactivates the possibility to upload a new JSON-LD file, so that you can send the URL to anyone to faithfully fill this metadata file! 📬

* **Disable adding or removing objects** in the form with `toysrus=closed`
  * e.g. https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor?toysrus=closed
  * It helps to ensure the people filling the form will comply with a given structure 

Combined: https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor?edit=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/csvw/gh-pages/tests%2Ftest086-metadata.json&toysrus=closed

## Metadata examples 📝

Here are a few examples of metadata templates to load from JSON-LD files URL:

* Edit Schema.org Dataset metadata (default): https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor?edit=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kodymoodley/fair-metadata-html-page-generator/main/testdata/inputdata/test.jsonld
* Edit CSV on the Web metadata: https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor?edit=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/csvw/gh-pages/tests%2Ftest086-metadata.json

## Tested ontologies ✔️

The following ontologies has been tested to be properly loaded when provided in `@context`

* [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) - from JSON-LD
  * https://schema.org/
* [CSV on the Web (CSVW)](https://w3c.github.io/csvw/primer/) - from JSON-LD
  * http://www.w3.org/ns/csvw
* [Semantic Science ontology (SIO)](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/semanticscience) - from RDF/XML
  * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/semanticscience/master/ontology/sio.owl
* [BioLink model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/) - from Turtle
  * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biolink/biolink-model/master/biolink-model.ttl

Ontologies are converted from RDF formats to JSON-LD using `rdflib-js`

> Please report if an ontology does not load properly by [creating an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/vemonet/jsonld-editor/issues).

## Known issues ⚠️

* It is **not possible to resolve HTTP URLs** from HTTPS (triggers a `mixed active content blocked` error). Deploying to github.io/maastrichtu-ids forces redirect to HTTPS
  * I currently rewrite ontologies URL using `http://` to `https://` before downloading them to work around this issue
  * It can be solved by redirecting GitHub Pages a custom URL, such as http://wizard.semanticscience.org, and accessing via HTTP

* Use `sx` style: https://mui.com/system/the-sx-prop/

### Development process

The best solution if you need to work on the JSON-LD editor, and test it quickly

Open 2 terminals:

🧑‍💻1️⃣. Go to the `json-ld-editor-react` root folder, and start the package building in watch mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

> The package will be automatically recompiled everytime you make changes to the component

🧑‍💻2️⃣. In the 2nd terminal, go to the `example` folder and deploy it locally

You can then run in development mode in the `example` folder:

```bash
cd example
yarn dev
```

> The webapp is deployed with `expo`, it will try to rebuild the  package automatically whenever it detects changes in the parent component. You can also manually trigger a rebuild with **Shift+R** without stopping the webapp.

<details><summary>You might need to link the 2 folders with yarn the first time you install for better interaction when the components is changed</summary>

Create a link in the `json-ld-editor-react` root folder:

```bash
yarn link
```

Use this local link in `/example`:

```bash
cd example
yarn link json-ld-editor-react
```

You will need to do it only once.
