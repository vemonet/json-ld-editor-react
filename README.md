# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìù FAIR Metadata Wizard, a JSON-LD editor

**Load and edit JSON-LD RDF metadata files** in a user-friendly web interface, **with autocomplete** based on the classes and properties of the **ontology magically loaded** from `@context` ‚ú®Ô∏è

Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).

Deployed as a static website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Access üë©‚Äçüíª

Access the website at **[https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor üîó](https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor)**

A few URL parameters can be provided to automate some actions:

* **Provide the JSON-LD file to load** with `edit=https://my-jsonld`
  * e.g. https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor?edit=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/csvw/gh-pages/tests%2Ftest086-metadata.json
  * It will automatically load the JSON-LD available at this URL, and the ontology provided in `@context`. 
  * It also deactivates the possibility to upload a new JSON-LD file, so that you can send the URL to anyone to faithfully fill this metadata file! üì¨

* **Disable adding or removing objects** in the form with `toysrus=closed`
  * e.g. https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor?toysrus=closed
  * It helps to ensure the people filling the form will comply with a given structure 

Combined: https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor?edit=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/csvw/gh-pages/tests%2Ftest086-metadata.json&toysrus=closed

## Metadata examples üìù

Here are a few examples of metadata templates to load from JSON-LD files URL:

* Edit Schema.org Dataset metadata (default): https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor?edit=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kodymoodley/fair-metadata-html-page-generator/main/testdata/inputdata/test.jsonld
* Edit CSV on the Web metadata: https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor?edit=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/csvw/gh-pages/tests%2Ftest086-metadata.json

## Tested ontologies ‚úîÔ∏è

The following ontologies has been tested to be properly loaded when provided in `@context`

* [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) - from JSON-LD
  * https://schema.org/
* [CSV on the Web (CSVW)](https://w3c.github.io/csvw/primer/) - from JSON-LD
  * http://www.w3.org/ns/csvw
* [Semantic Science ontology (SIO)](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/semanticscience) - from RDF/XML
  * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/semanticscience/master/ontology/sio.owl
* [BioLink model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/docs/) - from Turtle
  * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biolink/biolink-model/master/biolink-model.ttl

Ontologies are converted from RDF formats to JSON-LD using `rdflib-js`

> Please report if an ontology does not load properly by [creating an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/vemonet/jsonld-editor/issues).

## Known issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

* It is **not possible to resolve HTTP URLs** from HTTPS (triggers a `mixed active content blocked` error). Deploying to github.io/maastrichtu-ids forces redirect to HTTPS
  * I currently rewrite ontologies URL using `http://` to `https://` before downloading them to work around this issue
  * It can be solved by redirecting GitHub Pages a custom URL, such as http://wizard.semanticscience.org, and accessing via HTTP

## Run in development üèóÔ∏è

Requirements:  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) installed.

Clone the repository, and get in the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vemonet/jsonld-editor 
cd jsonld-editor
```

Install dependencies :inbox_tray:

```bash
yarn
```

Web app will run on [http://localhost:19006 üèÉ](http://localhost:19006)

```bash
yarn dev
```

> The website should reload automatically at each changes to the code :arrows_clockwise:

Upgrade the packages versions in `yarn.lock` ‚è´Ô∏è

```bash
yarn upgrade
```

## Run in production üõ©Ô∏è

This website is automatically deployed by a [GitHub Actions worklow](https://github.com/vemonet/jsonld-editor/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Deploy+to+GitHub+Pages%22) to GitHub Pages at https://vemonet.github.io/jsonld-editor

You can build locally in the `/web-build` folder, and serve on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

```bash
yarn build
yarn serve
```

Or run directly using [Docker :whale:](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (requires [docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> Checkout the [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) file to see how we run the Docker image ‚õµÔ∏è

## Build package üì¶

Build with [React Native builder `bob`](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-builder-bob)

```bash
yarn prepare
```

Generate tarball:

```bash
npm pack
```

Test the package:

```bash
cd example
yarn remove json-ld-editor-react
yarn add ../json-ld-editor-react-0.0.1.tgz
yarn dev
```

Upgrade the package:

```bash
yarn upgrade ../json-ld-editor-react-0.0.1.tgz
```

### Development process

If you wish to work on the JSON-LD editor and test it quickly

Create a link in the `json-ld-editor-react` root folder:

```bash
yarn link
```

Use this local link in `/example`:

```bash
cd example
yarn link json-ld-editor-react
```

You will need to do it only once.

You can then run in development mode in the `example` folder:

```bash
yarn dev
```

> You will need to stop and restart the deployment everytime you make a change to the parent component
